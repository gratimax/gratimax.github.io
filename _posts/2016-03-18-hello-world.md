```python

There were a few things I wanted to write about
and a few interactives I wanted to make, so why not start a blog?
A couple of ideas have been floating around in my head for a while, and a blog
seems like the best place to keep them.

I figure that I'm mostly inspired by [David Nolen]'s blog and
[Mike Bostock]'s website, as I kept those two sites in mind when thinking about
my own blog. 

This blog is powered by [Jekyll] as a static site generator, and [ClojureScript]
on the frontend for interactives. If you're interested in doing something
similar, I highly recommend checking both of them out.
The theme is currently some modifications on top of the base Jekyll theme to
make it look more like [Poole], a theme that I think is really pretty. The
styling will probably change as I tweak it some more to my liking.

I've added Disqus for discussions, but it might be too heavy. I might look
into a widget that adds Hacker News discussions, since that could be both more
lightweight and relevant for discussions on this blog.
