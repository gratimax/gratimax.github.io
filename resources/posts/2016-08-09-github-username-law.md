# A GitHub Username Law

The function mapping from (people &cup; organizations) &rarr; ideal usernames on
GitHub is not injective.
Also can be phrased as "if you want that username, it's always taken".
This can be a source of a lot of pain sometimes.

Thankfully, for those of us who didn't register one of the last remaining ideal
Github usernames in 2011, there exists a mapping from
(people &cup; organizations) &rarr; serviceable usernames on GitHub.

(Also applies to the username-based social media service of your choice.)
